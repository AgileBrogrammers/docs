## A repo for task <kbd>[MG-8](https://zifan.atlassian.net/browse/MG-8)</kbd>

We will use this to learn Git  

**Tips**  
1. **Always keep you local repo up-to-date before pushing.**  ( avoid unnecessary conflicts )  
2. include the subject of changes in each commit 
3. Do not use `git push --force` without asking others.
4. It's always safe to create a new branch if you want to do try something new but risky. And then create a pull request once it's been verified (or tested) by other teammates.

**Q&A**
1. **How should we create a repo that connects to JIRA?**  
Create a repo in *AgileBrogrammers Organization* on Github, and make a commit with a message that contains the issue code. For exmaple `git commit -m 'this is a commit related to MG-8'`
